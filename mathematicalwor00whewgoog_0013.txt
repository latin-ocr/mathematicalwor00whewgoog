physicel grounds of mathematioal truths3 hetdo not be·
long to the't progressive line of mathematical speculation
to which Barrow had referred in his Profatory Lecture
when he spoke ol Gelileo, Gessendi, Gilbert, Mersenne,
Gertesius, end others. Berrow’s contributions to this kind

of methematios appear in his Lectiones Optieae, and Lec-
tiones Geometricae, ss we shall see.

But next after the Lectiones Mathematicae, 1 hare
printed four lectures, in which he proposes to himself, as
he says, to expoundthe. method‘by which Archimedes ina
uented his beautiful theorems: (those, namely, concerning
Onnes and Sphores, their Solid Contents and Snrfaoes). This
he says he will do by reduoing the steps to problems, such
as Archimedes proposed to himself, and from the solution
of which he deduced both his theorems, and the mode of
demonstreting them: whence, hc says, it will appear what
was the cnelysis which he used, and how like our modern
analysis it was. Itis a thought which hes often suggested
itselfto the readers of the ancient Greek mathematicians,
end especially of Archimedes, that those writers must have
been led to their geometricel theorems and proofs by some
methodical analytice] process. Their constructione and pro·
positione are so complex, recondite, and abstruse, that it
seemed impossible that any-one should be led to them by
mere direct exercise cf ingenuity or felicity ef conjecture
We know that some modern mathematicieus, particularly
Newton, have followed this practice, of discovering a prce
position by analysis end then proving it by a geometricol
synthesis. Burrow hae, in the four Lectores here given,
proved, partly by tho use of algebreical sualysis, some of
the most difficult of the Propositions of Archimedes'con·¹
cerning Spheres and Genese for instance, that which forms
the last proposition in these Lectures, that of all Segments
of Spheres, of eqnel extent of surface, the Homisphere has
the largest content: a proposition which might be found
difficult to demonstrate by a good mathematician of the
