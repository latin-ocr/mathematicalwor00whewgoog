of Henry Lucas, the founder of th'e Professor'ship, 'given
in Barrow's usual rhetorical manner.⁴ He begins by re·
forring to the tranquillity which had been restored to the
nution hythe cessation oi the civil wars. “The turmoil
of public business being reduced tc rest, and the resto-
ration oi tranquillity having given you some heart to toll
and to hear news, listen tc me, Academica, while 1 haste
to tell yon something strange and almost o pmdigy.
There has shone forth oi late-What? yon will say.
Some dire mmet, the presaga of calamity, such as are
seen in numbers every day (in spite of the hearens them·
solves) by the distortcd vision of fanatica? No: buta
'new and benignent star, shining with a ray both true and
pmpitious, such aa has not t'or many years risen above the
academieal horinon. And it is that 1 may measure its
magnitude, explain its motione, and interpret its presaga,
that I now come forwerds, no vain astrologer I.” Itis
by this image, and others in the same strain, that he
describes Irncee, and his good deeds towards the Univer·
sity. Tho anasian Professcoehip which he founded he
cndowed with tha rents oi an estate in¹ Bedfordshire,
emonnting at present tc 5155. Barrow mentions the
principal circumstances oi Lucas‘s life· stating that hc
had studiari at St John’s Golloge, and was then taken
into the family of the Earl of Helland, (who was Chan-
cellor of the University from 1625 to 1648,) es his Scene
tary. Here, by attention to business and economy, he
aoeumulated a considerable fortune3 and continuing un-
married, resolved to make posterity hio heir. He repre*
sented the University in Parliament from 1640; and as
his end approached‚ considered and consulted with his
friends how he could best promote its interests. The
result was that he determined to give encouragement to

mathematicel- studies, which,·though admired always, and

have also venturos to npcet in thisJPrefaee soma of the mmmks which I
made in the Pmsaea to that volume. · ²
