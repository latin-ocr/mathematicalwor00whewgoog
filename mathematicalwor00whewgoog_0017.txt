The peculiarity of the method consiste in the coepe
which I hene marked (1) end (ἣ) thetis, therejection of
superfluous terme. And the Rule given by Barrow ie this:

*After constituting the equetion to the curve, put-x -' c
end y — e so'r the ordineten ce end y: expnnd, end reject all
the terme in which there ie rio a or e; (for hheydestroy ecch
other by the ‚nature of the curve ;) reject all the terme in
which a or eere above the first power, or ere multiplied
together: (for they are of no velue compared with the
rest, es being infinitely small ε) then put y for a, end t the
subtengent for e; end PT io found.

It is plain that the terme thus retained are the herme
involving the first powers of a end e, when, in the equetion
