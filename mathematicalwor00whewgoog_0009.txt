PREFAOE.

In· wee thought right, by Berrow's College, thet e new
edition 51 515 Μ5555ι5551551 Worhs should eoeompeny the
edition 51 515 Theologicel Works letely pnblished hythe
University, under the editoriel cere 51 Mr Nepier3 ond Ι
heve willingly undertshen 5ο superintend the printing 51
555 edition 5555 agreed upon. I heve elreedy, in 555
Profeee 515555 51 115 Nepier’s Edition, given an ec·
count 51 Barrow’s mathematicel writings; bnt for the soke
51 convenienoeIwill here resume the subject, f

Berrow’s first mathematicel publication appears 55
heve been his edition 51 Euclid. I heve supposed in my
former Notioe that this was published in 1654, before he
set ont upon his trevels. But the first edition is dated
1655. It is probeble thet he left 555 manuscript to be
printed efter 515 departure3 for in 555 Profeoe he seys thet
he hes tried to reduce the book into 5 smell speoe:
“Id quod essecutus videor, si absentem Typogrephi cure
non nuscetur? This edition contains all the fisteen
Bocks of Euclid's Elements¹. Ι 55511 555 insert the
hnlk 515515 publication in the present edition; but 55 555
end of this Preietory Notice I will insert Barrew’s Dedi·
cetion and Prehce to this book. The Dedicction 15 ed·
dressed to three young men, who, from the terme in which

they ere spoken of, must heve been, I conceive, Berrow'e
pupils. They were Edwerd Cecil, son 51 555 Earl 51
