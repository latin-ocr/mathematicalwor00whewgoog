tronagc in the University„ Barrow goes on to extend
his praises to the two enses ol Lucas'swillr Robsrt
Raworth,a lawyer, and Thomas Buck, aresidcnt in the
Univemhy, whom hc refers to os well-known to his
hearers3 “the same whose stately presence and dignified
courtenance is every day before your eyes ;'’ and to him he
ascribes the suggestion of Lucas’s benefaction. These tw03
in conjunction with the Heads of Collega, and especially
tha Vice-chancallors of 1663 and 1664, carchrlly and diris
gently took the proper steps tor carrying the bequest into
effect. .

He then proceeds to spcalr of his own hstes, and ol

with a vindication ol Euclid’s Doctrina of Propertion.
Ihave annaxed to these, at the foot of tha page, abrici

a large acquaintance with the literature ol Mathematica‚
both ancient and modern. As I hara stated in the former
account of Barrow, an English translation of these Les.
tures was published in 17343 but so badly execnted that
it cannot bc of use to any one. The Lectores themselves
are of interest to those who lora to dwell on' tha mata,
