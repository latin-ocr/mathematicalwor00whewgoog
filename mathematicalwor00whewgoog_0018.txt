Berrow appliee thie method to the following curves:
(Ι use the modern notation for the ooordinatee ε)

Ex. 11. The curve a⁸÷y⁸=r⁸.

Ex. 111. The curve a⁸÷ fancy, which it appears
was called La (tautae.

Ex. v. The curwe in which the aheeieaa being equul ,

to an are of a circle, the ordinate ia equal to ie trigonome·
trieal tangent:

Alae we may rogerd Barrow’a mode oi finding the areae
of curves by comparing them with the aum of the inscribed
and circumserihed parallelograma (Leet. 111.Append.2,
fig. 175,176), aa leading the way to Newton‘a method oi
doing the eume, given in the Firat Section of the Principia.

I have, for the meat part, retained Barrow'e notatim,
with slight alteratione where it would have been likely to
mielead a medem reader. Thus where we write A ι Β he
writes A.B, and where wewrite A>B he writes ΑΓΒ.
Ι have retained Aq sor A', Α σιώ for Aa Aqq sor A* and
the like.

It ie amatter of labour and difficulty ior a render iu
these days to follow out the complex eouetruotioua and
reaeoniuge of a mathematieian of Burrow‘a time; aud Ido
not pretend that Ihave in all eaeee gone through them to
my satisfaction. I have however, in several eeeee, en·
deawoured to aaaiet my madet to follow these demonstratione
with moderata trouble.
